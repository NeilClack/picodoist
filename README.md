# picodoist

Picodoist is a hardware based Todoist extension for those of us with ADHD.   
The idea is simple:  
> Have a simple, no features device to keep track of your todo's, without distractions.  

## Design  
Picodoist consists of only a few components, and as little code as possible.  
A Raspberry Pi Pico for brains, an E-Ink display for displaying items, and a USB power supply, possibly one of those old phone chargers you have laying around?  

## Setup  
Setup of the Picodoist is easy!  

There are two ways to get started. Purchase everything yourself, print the parts, put everything together, setup the pi, load the code, add your keys and you're off to the races.  

OR  

Buy a Picodoist assembled, or as a kit, and just add your keys!  
If you buy from me, I'll have the micropython firmware loaded already, and the code setup, all you have to do is provide your Todoist API key.  

For detailed instructions on both, keep reading.
